            <p>
                <strong>Anthropic Claude Code:</strong> {`In late February 2025, Anthropic introduced Claude Code, an "agentic" AI coding tool built into the developer's command-line terminal. Claude Code acts as an active collaborator that developers can interact with in natural language. Its capabilities go far beyond simple code completion – developers can delegate substantial engineering tasks to Claude Code directly from their terminal. For example, Claude can search and read code, edit files, write and run tests, use command-line tools, and even commit and push code to repositories like GitHub.`}
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>{`GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode:`}</strong> {`GitHub's Copilot, originally launched in 2021 as an AI pair-programmer, has recently been upgraded with more autonomous features. In early February 2025, GitHub announced a new "agent mode" for Copilot that allows it to iterate on its own output and correct errors automatically. In this mode, Copilot can generate code to fulfill a given task, run that code, observe the results (including any runtime errors), and then adjust its solution accordingly.`}
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Other Notable Tools:</strong> {`The AI coding arena is crowded with both big tech and startups releasing improvements. OpenAI's GPT-4 continues to power many coding assistants and has seen fine-tuning and plugin enhancements to better handle code.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>From Code Author to Code Curator:</strong> {`Developers are shifting from being the sole authors of code to curators and editors of AI-generated code. Engineers now guide the AI (through prompts or high-level instructions), then evaluate the outputs critically. The developer's role becomes somewhat analogous to a tech lead or editor: setting direction, verifying quality, and handling the nuanced cases.`}
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>New Skills and AI Literacy:</strong> {`Mastering AI tools has become a crucial skill for modern software engineers.
